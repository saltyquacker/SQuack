Thank you for using SQuack for Android!

This game is an open source Android app developed by SaltyQuackerGames. The source code is available on GitHub under MIT license, while the app is also available on Google Play.


The app does not collect or analyze any personally indentifiable information, only Twitch.TV aliases and logged dates. This is a personal project that can also be found on my website https://qcode.ca.


If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please do not hesitate to email me!

Thank you!
